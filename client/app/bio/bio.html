           Software development is my passion. Although I consider myself as a Mean Stack Developer. I am unafraid to learn an unfamiliar language, framework, api, or different role altogether. I am a problem solver before I am a Javascript programmer. Give me a confrontation, and I will not back down until it is resolved.
